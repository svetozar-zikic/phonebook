Phonebook WebApp

=============================================

This is an application I made after Java Web Development Course I attended from February until May of 2017.

I wanted to make this one for a while. I got the idea while I worked in Shipboard IT a few years ago. Every time I needed to find someone's
phone # onboard, I had to go through a printed phonebook. Now that I have a base model working, I will add complexity to the model by adding
departments, maybe even vessels.

Basic info:

Eclipse IDE

Maven project

SPA

Spring
